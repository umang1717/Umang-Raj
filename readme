I am excited to share my latest data analysis project on Bollywood movies!

Bollywood isn’t just entertainment—it’s a massive industry full of trends, patterns, and stories hidden in the numbers. Using a comprehensive Bollywood Movies dataset, I explored various aspects of the film industry through the power of Python.

This analysis includes:

Exploring the most popular genres across different release periods

Comparing the success of remakes versus original movies

Studying the relationship between budget and revenue

Highlighting the most featured and highest-grossing lead stars

And uncovering some unexpected trends along the way!


I used Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to transform raw data into meaningful insights and visualizations.

If you're passionate about data or love Bollywood, this project brings both worlds together in a fascinating way. Let the numbers tell the story behind the silver screen!
